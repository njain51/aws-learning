- Testing the Elastic Load Balancer
  - Navigate to your Target Group created and check if instances status changes to healthy

  - Stop instance MyEC2Server1
  - When we now go to our Target Group it will show instance1 health status as `unused`
  - ![img_5.png](../images/2_1.2_5.png)
  - And ELB DNS will now direct all traffic to instance 2 only. 
  - Delete LB then Delete Target group and then Terminate both instances before you end lab.
